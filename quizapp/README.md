# App Time! Lessons üèÖ

This app was adapted from [this quiz app](https://github.com/bonham000/react-quiz-app) and then again from [this multiple choice quiz app for freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/bonham000/multiple-choice-questions) provides a practice testing and development environment for freeCodeCamp's multiple-choice interview questions.

**[It's running live here for you to practice on.](https://app-time-lessons.surge.sh/)**

These are quiz lessons to help you learn the basic concepts of JavaScript and programming.

The challenges all live in the `src/challenges` directory. Each category has a separate `JSON` file which is structured similar to the other challenge seed files in the core freeCodeCamp repository. To contribute a challenge, simply make a pull request with your challenge question(s) in the appropriate seed file.

To run this project locally:
